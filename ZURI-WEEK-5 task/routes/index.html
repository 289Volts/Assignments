            Hello, I'm Roland. I am a internet-taught
            frontend
            developer with an eye for good design. I took an
            interest in web development because of my innate passion for building things and solving
            problems.
        </p>
        <p>When i'm not coding, you'll either find me playing Call of Duty Mobile or
            on YouTube watching game replays from my
            favorite
            gamer
